# Review: Português (Brasil) (pt-BR)

One section per surface. The app's catalog state is `REVIEW` in `frontend/src/i18n/locales.ts`; the landing's is `review` in
`site/i18n/locales.mjs`.

## Landing

Status: `machine-draft` (shown as "Beta translation" in the page footer).
Reviewer: none yet. Date: none yet. Catalog: `site/i18n/landing.pt-BR.json`, first drafted with the PR that added it.

Register: Brazilian forms only, você.

To mark the review done, set `review: 'native-reviewed'` for this locale in `site/i18n/locales.mjs` (the page then drops the
"Beta translation" note), and record the reviewer, date and catalog commit above.

### Strings that need a native look

- `hero.l1` «escrevem posts» (post is the accepted term).
- `net.live` «Ativa» is feminine to agree with «rede»; check against the other badges.
- `footer.text` «auto-hospedada».
- All strings are machine-drafted from `landing.en.json` with `glossary.csv`; none has been back-translated yet. Errors and
  confirmations do not appear on the landing page, so the risk is wording and tone, not meaning.
- Docs and the demo stay English; links to them carry "(EN)".
